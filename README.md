🕵️ Threat Hunting Investigation Report

Incident: Confidential Pricing Data Exposure

Company: Azuki Import/Export Trading Co.

Date Range Investigated: 2025-11-19 to 2025-11-20

Telemetry Source: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

------

📌 Executive Summary

Azuki Import/Export Trading Co. identified indicators of a potential security
breach after a competitor undercut a 6-year shipping contract 
by exactly 3%, strongly suggesting access to confidential pricing data. 
This suspicion was further validated when supplier contracts 
and pricing documentsappeared on underground forums, 
indicating unauthorized data exfiltration.


A structured threat hunting investigation was conducted
using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry to
identify initial access, attacker behavior, 
persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, and impact.

Observed results

Conclusion

-------

1️⃣ Initial Access – Suspicious Process Execution
🎯 Objective

Identify how the attacker gained initial access to the environment.

🔎 Detection Logic (KQL)

-----

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "azuki-sl"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("winword.exe","excel.exe","outlook.exe","powershell.exe","cmd.exe")
| project Timestamp, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp asc

----

🧪 Results

winword.exe spawning powershell.exe

PowerShell executed with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Command shells launching scripts

✅ Conclusion

The initial access vector is consistent with phishing-based macro execution, leading to PowerShell-based payload delivery.

2️⃣ Initial Access – Remote Desktop Entry Point
🎯 Objective

Identify the remote source used for initial access.

DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType == "RemoteInteractive"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemoteIPType
| order by Timestamp asc

🔎 Result

Remote IP: 88.97.178.12

3️⃣ Compromised Account Identification
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType == "RemoteInteractive"
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
| where RemoteIP == "88.97.178.12"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName

🔎 Result

Compromised Account: kenji.sato

4️⃣ Discovery – Network Enumeration
🎯 Objective

Detect reconnaissance activity on the internal network.

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "azuki"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "arp"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| project Timestamp, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine

🔎 Result

Command Used: arp -a

✅ Conclusion

The attacker enumerated network neighbors to identify lateral movement targets.

5️⃣ Defense Evasion – Malware Staging Directory
