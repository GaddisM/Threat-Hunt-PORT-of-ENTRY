# Threat Hunting Case Study  
## Insider-Enabled Data Exfiltration via Living-off-the-Land Techniques  
**Platform:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
**Focus:** End-to-End Threat Hunting using KQL  
**MITRE ATT&CK–Aligned Investigation**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Azuki Import/Export Trading Co. identified a potential data breach after a competitor undercut a six-year shipping contract by **exactly 3%**, strongly indicating exposure of confidential pricing data. Subsequent intelligence revealed that internal supplier contracts and pricing documents were advertised on underground forums.

A full threat-hunting investigation was conducted using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry to identify the **initial access vector, attacker behavior, compromised assets, and business impact**.

## 5. Initial Access — Suspicious Process Execution

### Objective
Identify malicious execution patterns associated with phishing or script-based compromise.

### Why This Query
Office applications spawning PowerShell or CMD often indicate macro-based phishing or malicious document execution.

### KQL Query
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "azuki-sl"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("winword.exe","excel.exe","outlook.exe","powershell.exe","cmd.exe")
| project Timestamp, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp asc






1️⃣ Initial Access – Suspicious Process Execution
🎯 Objective

Identify how the attacker gained initial access to the environment.

🔎 Detection Logic (KQL)


DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "azuki-sl"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("winword.exe","excel.exe","outlook.exe","powershell.exe","cmd.exe")
| project Timestamp, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp asc


🧪 Results

winword.exe spawning powershell.exe

PowerShell executed with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Command shells launching scripts

✅ Conclusion

The initial access vector is consistent with phishing-based macro execution, leading to PowerShell-based payload delivery.

--------
2️⃣ Initial Access – Remote Desktop Entry Point
🎯 Objective

Identify the remote source used for initial access.

DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType == "RemoteInteractive"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemoteIPType
| order by Timestamp asc

🔎 Result

Remote IP: 88.97.178.12

-------

3️⃣ Compromised Account Identification
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType == "RemoteInteractive"
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
| where RemoteIP == "88.97.178.12"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName

🔎 Result

Compromised Account: kenji.sato

-------

4️⃣ Discovery – Network Enumeration
🎯 Objective

Detect reconnaissance activity on the internal network.

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "azuki"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "arp"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-11-19) .. datetime(2025-11-20))
| project Timestamp, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine

🔎 Result

Command Used: arp -a

✅ Conclusion

The attacker enumerated network neighbors to identify lateral movement targets.

---------

5️⃣ Defense Evasion – Malware Staging Directory
